# Database Normalization.
  Def: This is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
 ## First Normal Form(1NF)
* The raw ''Order Sales'' data in this website was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data) and is set to undergo normalization using the PgAdmin RDBMS, powered by the PostgreSQL database engine.
* 1NF assumptions checked at this stage include:
    1. Atomicity: Each column must contain single, indivisible vaalues (no lists on grouped data).
    2. Uniqueness: Every row should be uniquely identifiable with a primary key which is a combination of "Order Number"+"Order Line Number".
    3. No Repeating Groups: Data should be structured so that there are no duplicate columns for similar data.
    4. Consistent Data Types: Each column should store only one type of data (e.g numbers in numeric columns, text in string columns).
    5. Each Field Contains Single Values: No multiple values in a single column.
* The table created from it has 2823 rows and 25 columns as shown below.
* The rows in the table can also be filtered using the form above it.
' as contents_md;

select 
    'text' as component,
    --TRUE   as article,
    '50%' as width,
    '
## Second Normal Form(2NF)
* Second Normal Form (2NF) Assumptions rely on meeting the conditions of First Normal Form (1NF) while addressing partial dependency issues. 
* Hereâ€™s what 2NF assumes:
   1. It must first be in 1NF â€“ meaning no repeating groups and atomic values in every column.
   2. Eliminates Partial Dependencies â€“ all non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the whole primary key, not just part of it.
   3. Applies to Composite Keys â€“ if a table has a single-column primary key, it automatically satisfies 2NF. 
        The real need arises when dealing with composite keys, where dependencies on only part of the key must be removed.
* To achieve 2NF, we often split tables to remove partial dependencies, ensuring each table has attributes that depend on the full primary key.

select 
    'text' as component,
    --TRUE   as article,
    '50%' as width,
    '
## Third Normal Form(3NF)
* A table is in 3NF if it meets the following conditions:
  1. It is in Second Normal Form (2NF) â€“ This means there are no partial dependencies (i.e., no non-prime attribute depends on only part of a candidate key).
  2. It has no transitive dependencies â€“ No non-key attribute should depend on another non-key attribute. Instead, all non-key attributes must depend directly on the primary key.

* Since country does not depend directly on the primary key column of the "States" table, that is "State ID", we get a transitive dependency.This violates the rules of 3NF.

    SET "Cntry ID" = c."Cntry ID"
    FROM "Country" c
    WHERE "States"."Country" = c."Country";

    ALTER TABLE "States"
    DROP COLUMN "Country";

    ALTER TABLE "Cust City"
    DROP COLUMN "State",
    DROP COLUMN "Country";
```
* Insert "State ID" into the "Cust City" as foreign key field, then populate the column using "State ID" from "States" table.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE "Cust City"
    ADD COLUMN "State ID" BIGINT,
    ADD CONSTRAINT st_fk FOREIGN KEY("State ID") REFERENCES "States"("State ID");

    UPDATE "Cust City"
    SET "State ID" = "States"."State ID"
    FROM "States" 
    WHERE  "Cust City"."State"= "States"."State";
    ```
* I realized that some cities with more than one postal code existed in my "Cust City", with an exception of ''Glendale''.
* I use the window function ROW_NUMBER() to fetch duplicate values in the "City" column as follows: 
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM
    (
    SELECT "City ID","City","Postal Code","State",
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY "City" ORDER BY "City" ASC) AS city_cnt
    FROM "Cust City") AS x;
    ```

* Update the "Cust City" table with the first occurence of the "Postal Code" of a duplicate city record.
* Do not update for ''Glendale'' city since it exists in more than one state. Sounds like a table self-updateðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—.
    ```sql
    UPDATE "Cust City"
    SET "Postal Code" = x."Postal Code"
    FROM( 
        SELECT "City ID","City","Postal Code",
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY "City" ORDER BY "City" ASC) AS city_cnt
        FROM "Cust City") AS x
    WHERE x.city_cnt = 1 AND
        x."City" = "Cust City"."City" AND
        x."City" <>''Glendale'';
    ```

* Delete from the "Cust City" duplicate record in the "City" column.
* N/B : "City ID" is a foreign column in "Customer" table, so we cannot delete the record directly from "Cust City".
*     :  We need to delete the records with the "City ID" returned in the query below from the "Customer" table first
    ```sql
    CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_id AS 
    SELECT "City ID"
    FROM (SELECT "City ID","City",ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY "City" ORDER BY "City" ASC) AS city_count
        FROM "Cust City")
        WHERE city_count>1
        AND "City"<>''Glendale'';   --- This is a temporary table for the open session only.
    ```
* Delete from "Customer" table the "City ID" returned in the above query as follows:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM "Customer" 
    WHERE "City ID" IN(SELECT * FROM temp_id);

    DELETE FROM "Cust City"
    WHERE "City ID" IN(SELECT * FROM temp_id);
                        
    SELECT * FROM "Cust City";
    SELECT * FROM "States";
    SELECT * FROM "Country";
    ```
    * Check:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "Customer";
    ```
    ***Already in 3NF***

    * Check:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "Products"; 
    ```
* Already in 3NF since both the ''Product Line'' and "Retail Price" depend directly on the "Product Code" column.
* However, we need to break "Product Line" from the table "Products" then create a "Line Code" on "Products",foreign key column.
* Then update the "Products" table accordingly.

		CREATE TABLE "Product Line" 
		  (
		    "Line Code"  BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1),
			"Product Line" VARCHAR(100)
		  );

		  INSERT INTO "Product Line"("Product Line")
		  SELECT DISTINCT "Product Line"
		  FROM "Products";
		  
		  SELECT * FROM "Product Line";

		  ALTER TABLE "Products"
